Here are the first 12 Projects I want to complete not initially in order but within time I want to complete these. As I beleive some of these tools and features can be employed succesfully in the future.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1 | Basic Informatics
------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------
[1] | DNS Cache Monitoring and Malicious IP Detection: Periodically collect cached DNS entries on a Windows workstation, store them, check them on VirusTotal using API calls, and trigger an alert if any malicious IP is found.
[2] | Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS): Develop an NIDS that monitors network traffic for suspicious patterns and raises alerts on potential intrusion attempts or security breaches.
[3] | Password Manager and Generator: Create a secure password manager and generator that stores passwords encrypted locally and generates strong, unique passwords for different websites.
[4] | Cyber Threat Intelligence Platform: Build a platform that aggregates and analyzes cyber threat intelligence from various sources to provide real-time insights and proactive defense mechanisms.
[5] | Vulnerability Scanner: Develop a tool that scans networks or web applications for vulnerabilities and provides detailed reports for remediation.
[6] | Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation: Implement a 2FA system to add an extra layer of security for user logins and transactions.
[7] | Malware Analysis Sandbox: Build a sandbox environment for analyzing and dissecting malware samples to understand their behavior and potential impact.
[8] | Secure File Encryption and Decryption Utility: Create a file encryption and decryption utility using strong encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data.
[9] | Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System: Design a SIEM system that centralizes and correlates security logs and events from various sources to detect and respond to security incidents.
[10] | Phishing Website Detection: Develop a tool to identify and analyze phishing websites, helping users avoid falling victim to phishing attacks.
[11] | Wireless Network Security Analyzer: Build a tool that analyzes the security of wireless networks, detects vulnerabilities like weak passwords or WPA/WEP encryption, and suggests improvements.
[12] | Digital Forensics Analysis Tool: Create a tool for digital forensics investigations, allowing investigators to extract and analyze evidence from digital devices.
